# RIP Next Steps & Roadmap 🚀

## 🔥 Immediate Priorities (Next Session)

### 1. NPM Publishing Pipeline
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for multi-platform binary builds (Linux, macOS Intel/ARM, Windows)
- [ ] Create postinstall.js script for binary download from GitHub Releases
- [ ] Test npm package locally before publishing
- [ ] Publish to npm registry with `npm publish`
- [ ] Verify `npx rip` works globally

### 2. Integration Testing
- [ ] Write comprehensive integration tests in `tests/integration_tests.rs`
- [ ] Test against various project types (Node.js, Python, Rust, etc.)
- [ ] Validate web scanning against test servers
- [ ] Performance benchmarking with large codebases

### 3. Polish & Bug Fixes
- [ ] Fix clippy warnings (unused imports, dead code)
- [ ] Add more robust error messages
- [ ] Improve terminal UI for non-interactive environments
- [ ] Add `--quiet` and `--verbose` output modes

## 🎯 Short-term Enhancements (1-2 weeks)

### Enhanced Scanning Capabilities
- [ ] **Entropy-based secret detection** using `secretscan` crate
- [ ] **Git history scanning** for committed secrets
