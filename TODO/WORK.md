# RIP Work Items & Production Readiness ðŸš€

## ðŸ”¥ Critical for NPX Release

### NPM Publishing Pipeline
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for multi-platform binary builds (Linux, macOS Intel/ARM, Windows)
- [ ] Create postinstall.js script for binary download from GitHub Releases
- [ ] Test npm package locally before publishing
- [ ] Publish to npm registry with `npm publish`
- [ ] Verify `npx rip` works globally

### Final Code Quality
- [ ] Run final `cargo clippy` check and fix any remaining warnings
- [ ] Run `cargo fmt` to ensure consistent formatting
- [ ] Verify all tests pass with `cargo test`
- [ ] Test the application end-to-end with various project types

## ðŸŽ¯ Realistic Near-term Improvements

### Essential Features for v0.2.0
- [ ] Add `--quiet` and `--verbose` output modes for CI/CD usage
- [ ] Implement JSON output format for programmatic consumption
- [ ] Add basic configuration validation and better error messages
- [ ] Improve handling of binary files and very large repositories

### Documentation & User Experience
- [ ] Update placeholder URLs in README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- [ ] Add actual screenshots or GIF of the TUI in action to README
- [ ] Create simple getting started guide with common use cases
- [ ] Document all configuration options in detail

### Security Enhancements (Achievable)
- [ ] Implement entropy-based detection for high-likelihood secrets
- [ ] Add custom regex patterns support via config file
- [ ] Improve .gitignore parsing and respect for ignored files
- [ ] Add basic file content type detection beyond extensions

## ðŸ”§ Medium-term Goals (Skill Building)

### Enhanced Scanning
- [ ] Git history scanning for accidentally committed secrets
- [ ] Incremental scanning (only scan changed files)
- [ ] Support for more programming languages and frameworks
- [ ] Better handling of false positives through allowlists

### Web Scanner Improvements
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate basic analysis
- [ ] Better handling of redirects and custom 404 pages
- [ ] Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming target servers
- [ ] Custom wordlists for common sensitive file paths

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Docker image for containerized scanning
- [ ] Git pre-commit hook integration
- [ ] Basic CI/CD examples for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
- [ ] Simple integration guide for popular development workflows

## ðŸ“¦ Production Readiness Checklist

### Before Public Release
- [ ] Comprehensive testing on various operating systems
- [ ] Performance testing with large repositories (1GB+)
- [ ] Security review of web scanning capabilities
- [ ] Legal review of dependencies and licensing
- [ ] Create proper semantic versioning strategy

### Community Readiness
- [ ] Set up GitHub Issues templates
- [ ] Create basic contributing guidelines
- [ ] Establish security disclosure process
- [ ] Document project governance and maintenance approach

## ðŸŽ¨ Polish & Professional Touch

### User Interface
- [ ] Ensure ASCII art renders correctly across terminals
- [ ] Improve progress indicators and status messages
- [ ] Add better error handling and user-friendly messages
- [ ] Test terminal compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Branding & Presentation
- [ ] Consistent styling across all terminal output
- [ ] Professional error messages and help text
- [ ] Clean up any debug output or development artifacts
- [ ] Ensure consistent terminology throughout documentation

## ðŸš« Explicitly NOT Planned (Scope Creep Prevention)

- Complex ML/AI features for secret detection
- Full vulnerability scanning beyond basic checks
- Enterprise features like RBAC or team management
- Web-based dashboard or SaaS offering
- Mobile applications or GUI interfaces
- Integration with complex security information systems

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics for v1.0

- Successfully installable via `npx rip` on all major platforms
- Scans typical development repositories in under 30 seconds
- Detects common secrets with minimal false positives
- Clear, actionable output that developers can understand
- Stable API for CI/CD integration
- Active community usage and feedback
